# Changelog

## 3.0.1 - Minecraft 1.21.11

This update focuses on making InputBooster feel more complete for everyday players while keeping the mod stable during combat and low-FPS gameplay.

### Added

- Module system for combat, movement, debug, profiles, anti-idle, and replay features.
- Per-server profile backend so settings can switch automatically for different servers.
- Input replay tools:
  - `R` starts or stops replay recording.
  - `K` plays the recorded replay.
- Advanced CPS limiter modes:
  - `FIXED`
  - `HUMANIZED`
  - `COOLDOWN`
  - `WEAPON_AWARE`
- Safe mode that disables active modules after repeated internal errors.
- Keybind conflict detection with event-log reporting.
- Event log backend for recent InputBooster activity.
- Config tools for presets, import, and export.
- Overlay lines for modules, replay status, safe mode, and latest debug event.

### Changed

- Updated mod version to `3.0.1`.
- Profile saves now include the new CPS mode, replay, safe mode, event log, keybind warning, and per-server profile settings.
- CPS limiter now uses the selected CPS mode instead of only a fixed cap.

### Fixed

- Prevented queued mod attacks from firing while InputBooster is inactive or not initialized.
- Prevented stale queued inputs from firing later after the mod is toggled back on.
- Reduced the chance of one physical click causing both a mod entity attack and a vanilla entity attack.

### Build

- New jar: `build/libs/inputbooster-3.0.1.jar`
